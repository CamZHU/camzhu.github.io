Hi there, I'm a M.Sc. [Behavioural and Economics Sciences](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/study/bes/) student at Warwick University. I have completed my bachelor degree in Economics at the University of Nottingham.

I've worked on Computational Modeling for a few years as part of my research. I am a big fan of Python and open source solutions, and everything else that is included in "data science".
I am incredibly fortunate to work with great scientists: Cognitive Modeling of Human Risky Choice with Prof [Neil Stewart](https://www.stewart.warwick.ac.uk/) and A Reinforcement Learning Model of Animal Risky Choice with Prof [Elliot Ludvig](http://elliot.ludvig.ca/Home.html).
