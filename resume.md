Hi there, I'm a M.Sc. [Behavioural and Economics Sciences](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/study/bes/) student at Warwick University. I have completed my bachelor degree in Economics at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/).

I've worked on Computational Modeling for a few years as part of my research.
