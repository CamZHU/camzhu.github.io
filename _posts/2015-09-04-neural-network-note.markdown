**Universality Theorem**

In one sentence:

> Neural networks with a single hidden layer can be used to approximate any continuous function to any desired precision.

You can find a good introduction from [Michael Nielson's book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html#basic_network_precursor)
