I was first introduced to emotion/affective computing literature by [this IJCAI paper](http://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/125.pdf).

It is not novel to combine emotions and decision making.
Scientists have a long history of affective decision making researches.

However, to elicit emotional responses from model-based reinforcement learning is new to me.

Model-based RL inevitably includes planning and this is why the authors focus on particular emotions that emerges with anticipating future events (hope & fear).

Their computational models of hope and fear abides to [psychological Belief-Desire Theory of Emotion](http://emr.sagepub.com/content/1/3/214.short)

In nutshell, the formula is the product of upward mobility (in the terminology of Dan Ariely) and the probability of enjoying such upward future improvements.

Some interesting simluations tasks were done to test the emotional model.
If you familiar with RL literature, cliff walking is a classic scenario to test behavioral policies.
The environment is illustrated below:

<img src="/images/paper5_2" style="width: 80%; height: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

slippery path is in grey and the objective of an artificial agent is to move from start (S) to goal (G) as quick as possible (since every movement incur small negative value)

Clearly, the shortest path is also slippery which means highly likely the agent can fall into the cliff and died.
So there is a need for tradeoff here.

The simulation result compares 2 action selection policies: `e-greedy` and `softmax`.

The amount of fear generated by the agent is different under those policy.
One interesting observation is that `softmax` policy can anticipate the fear even the distance from the cliff is at the largest (4).


Future works on how this computational model of emotions can influence the decision making process is promising.
