### 1. Lectures & Visulizations  

Of course! we should learn from Geoffrey Hinton's lectures on [Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001)

Series of lectures from George State University's [Computational Neuroscience](http://www.ni.gsu.edu/~rclewley/Teaching/CompNeuro/NEUR4030.html) course

[How neural networks learn?](http://mwskirpan.com/NN_viz/): a good visualization of back-propagation.

[Neural networks in C++](https://vimeo.com/19569529): again, back-propagation.

The discussion about the impact of deep learning from [a computing perspective](https://medium.com/@cdixon/what-s-next-in-computing-e54b870b80cc#.gs9lyrj5p)

Rich Sutton's [Future of AI - why scalable methods hold the key?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD-FWetbvN8)


### 2. Neural network
