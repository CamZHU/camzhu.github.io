### 1. Lectures & Visulizations  

Of course! we should learn from Geoffrey Hinton's lectures on [Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001)

Series of lectures from George State University's [Computational Neuroscience](http://www.ni.gsu.edu/~rclewley/Teaching/CompNeuro/NEUR4030.html) course

[How neural networks learn?](http://mwskirpan.com/NN_viz/): a good visualization of back-propagation.

[Neural networks in C++](https://vimeo.com/19569529): again, back-propagation.



### 2. Readings

[How to get started with data science & machine learning?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-a-beginner-used-small-projects-to-get-started-in-machine-learning-and-compete-on-kaggle/)

[How neural networks learn?](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/post/129793362663/how-do-neural-networks-learn)

Demystifying [Deep Reinforcement Learning esp. Deep Q Net](http://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/)

### 3. Programming (from Python to Julia)

[Python and Machine learning by Sebastian Raschka](http://sebastianraschka.com/books.html)

[Image recognition libraries](http://www.cegapo.com/image-processing-libraries-w-12015/)


### 4. Future

[Ethical Machine](http://ethicalmachines.com/) 

[Deep Forger](https://twitter.com/deepforger)

Rich Sutton's [Future of AI - why scalable methods hold the key?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD-FWetbvN8)
