I wish to survey the `affective decision making` literature.
[This paper](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/27/6/763.full) may represents one of the most cutting-edge affective decision making models

The authors connect the idea of "feelings govern choice" to the prospect theory (K&T, 1979; 1992); 
that is, the subjective utility is a proxy for feelings, which in turn govern choice.
> humans described by Prospect Theory are guided by the immediate emotional impact of gains and losses. Kahneman (2011) Thinking Fast and Slow >


So why not directly measure emotions and test its ability in predicting choice?
Following this idea, the authors ask participants to self-report their feelings after completing risky choices.
They first tested the best-fitted feeling function (i.e., how risky outcomes relate translate into feelings)

And the simulation suggests the above model has the lowest BIC score (aka best fit).

The feeling function was further used into predicting gamble choice: `P(gamble)`.
The feeling model outperforms other decision making models in BIC scores.

I suspect fitting feeling functions to individuals might be more intersting because there are intuitively individual differences in emotional responses to same risky outcomes.
