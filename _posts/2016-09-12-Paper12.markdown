Couple more techniques were introduced to policy gradient method.

(1) Baseline

Recall the likelihood ratio gradient:

\begin{equation}
\nabla U(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \nabla_\theta log P(\tau^{(i)}; \theta) R(\tau^{(i)}) 
\end{equation}




(2) Step sizing and trust region


(3) Variance reduction by discounting


(4) Variance reduction by function approximation (=critic)
