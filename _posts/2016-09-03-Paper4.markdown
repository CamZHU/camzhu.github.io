[This theory paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268115002838) draws my attentions becauses it provides a new perspective to understand curious behaviors which I am particularly interested to study.

The new perspective is 'sense-making' (by words, it is about how organisms make sense of the environment).
Sense-making is well-studied by Gestalts psychologists and it was considered as a drive that motivates organisms to establish a more simple representation of the world.

How do you define simplicity? I don't find any formal method to quantify the term but some descriptive definition can be found: the shortest length of programming, Occam's razor, and Kolmogorov complexity.

Chater & Loewenstein listed out 4 key features of sense-making:

#### (1) Sense and sense-making are pleasurable and their opposite are aversive. 
For example, after absorbing new information, we update our understanding of the object (i.e., make better sense of it) --> then we should seek for this information ex ante. However, if we anticipate the arrival of new information would result in negative change in sense, a fear of such information (aka. information avoidance) may emerge.

#### (2) Sense-making is not equally pleasurable.
That is, the pleasure from sense-making depends critically on importantce. Usually, it is more important to us than others.

#### (3) Pleasures and pains of sense and sense-making depend on expectations.
This principle has a twin idea in reference points [(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
An example provided by Chater & Loewenstein is, in a museum, no pleasure or pain was derived from the blanck walls between paintings.

#### (4) Pleasures and pains of sense-making are not symmetric.
Again, it is stringly similar to [Kahneman & Tversky (1979)'s](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) loss aversion. This principle is based on the simple observation that having the newly-obtained information discredited, leave ones worse off (despite the fact that one is left in the same situation in which one began).



An illustration of the simplicity and sense-making and the associated pleasure/utility:

The hidden pattern maybe hard to find.

However, if we provide you with an additional informaiton a="these are the first six alphabet, in block capitals".
With this information in mind, the patterns suddenly become easier to make sense of.
The code length for this stimuli then shortened significantly.
