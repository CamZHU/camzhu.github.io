[Prosocial learning area was identified in the brain](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9763) thanks to reinforcement learning modeling.
The experiment is the basic 2-alternative forced task; one option has 75% reward rate and the other has 25% reward rate.
Participants don't know which option has higher reward rate at the beginning, and therefore they must learn by repeatedly sampling from experiences.

There are 3 conditions in the experiment: 

(A) play for yourself (i.e., the money you win from the experiment belong to you)

(B) play for others

(C) play for no one

Researchers fitted a simple model-free reinforcement learning model to each condition separately, and then they obtained the best-fitted learning rate (aka. step-size parameter, alpha) and temperature of the softmax function (the higher the temperature --> more random the predicted behavior)

Results indicate that 

(1) people in play for yourself have the highest learning rate (i.e., the fastest learner to find out the higher reward option.

(2) people in play for no one have the highest temperature (i.e., the most random choice behaviors are observed when people play for no one.)


fMRI data indicate that only sgACC is activated differently when learning to play for others, which may suggest that this area is related to prosocial learning.
