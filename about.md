Hi there, I'm a M.Sc. [Behavioural and Economics Sciences](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/study/bes/) student at Warwick University. 
Before, I have completed my bachelor degree in Economics at the University of Nottingham.


I've worked on Computational Modeling for a few years as part of my research with datasets ranging from human to nonhuman. 
I am a big fan of Python and open source solutions, and everything else that is included in the term "data science".
In my opinion, the best way to master data science is to make hands dirty. 
To jump right in and learn about data science, it is necessary to ignore long-ass search in theories and start writing code.



I am incredibly fortunate to work with great behavioral scientists: Cognitive Modeling of Human Risky Choice with Prof [Neil Stewart](https://www.stewart.warwick.ac.uk/) and A Reinforcement Learning Model of Animal Risky Choice with Prof [Elliot Ludvig](http://elliot.ludvig.ca/Home.html).
