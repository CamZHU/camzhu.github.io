Hi there, I'm a second-year PhD student of Psychology at the University of Warwick supervised by [Elliot Ludvig](http://elliot.ludvig.ca/Home.html). 
Before, I was trained as behavioral economists in Nottingham and Warwick.


I've worked on Computational Modeling for a few years as part of my research with data collected from human to nonhuman subjects. 
I am interested in reinforcement learning modelling of risky, social, and moral decision making.

I can be reached through [email](mailto:camb.zhu@gmail.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/JQ_Zhu).
