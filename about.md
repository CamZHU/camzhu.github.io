Hi there, I'm a first-year PhD student of Psychology at the University of Warwick supervised by [Elliot Ludvig](http://elliot.ludvig.ca/Home.html). 
Before, I completed a master in Behavioral Economics at the same institution and a bachelor in Economics at the University of Nottingham.


I've worked on Computational Modeling for a few years as part of my research with data collected from human to nonhuman subjects. 
I am interested in reinforcement learning modelling of risky, social, and moral decision making.
Prior to doctoral training, I have participated in Technion's modelling competition for human risky choices under the supervision of [Neil Stewart](https://www.stewart.warwick.ac.uk/). 
Our model introduced a pattern recognition perspective to explain the behavioural data. 
It was further validated to replicate existing behavioural anomalies, which are well-documented in the behavioural economics literature.


At present, my research centres on 1) building computational models to explain curiosity (e.g., preference for advance knowledge) and the 'savouring' behaviours; 2) advance the understanding of moral decision making with model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.
I'm working on new paradigm to test the theoretical boundaries of existing models and to propose new insights in our understanding of knowing advance information.
