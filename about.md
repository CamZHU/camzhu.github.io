Hi there, I'm a second-year PhD student of Psychology at the University of Warwick supervised by [Prof. Elliot Ludvig](http://elliot.ludvig.ca/Home.html) and [Prof. Adam Sanborn](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/people/asanborn/). 
Before, I was trained as a behavioral economist in Nottingham and Warwick.


I've worked on Computational Modeling for a few years as part of my research with data collected from human to nonhuman subjects.
