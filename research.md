### 1. Curiosity and Information Seeking

When faced with delayed, uncertain rewards, humans and other animals usually prefer to know the eventual outcomes in advance This preference for cues providing advance information can lead to seemingly suboptimal choices, where less reward is preferred over more reward. We build a reinforcement learning model of this information-seeking behavior, integrating imagination, planning, and decision making.

### 2. Foraging in Internal Environment

Both resources in the natural environment and concepts in a semantic space are distributed “patchily”, with large gaps in between the patches. Levy flight has been proved advantageous empirically and optimal theoretically in such pathy environment. It exhibits a power-law scaling of the flight distance, which is scale-free and self-similar. So does the temporal structure of human cognition, which shows 1/f-like fluctuations.
